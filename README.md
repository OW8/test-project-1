[YOUR ANSWER HERE]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? 

The first parts were not challenging because most of it was copy-paste and understanding the code, how implementation work, and how to use CSS, HTML, and JS. I encountered the challenge when I forget to put come in between the color changing background in the CSS cod but after reviewing it carefully I get it. The second challenging part when was adding the audion into the game and replacing it with my own audio and I overcame this challenge by debugging it and using the console in the inspection. The third challenge was implementing and giving the player three chances before losing the game and I get it after trying it and debugging it using VS Code and I finally get and I'm happy to complete all the option parts from 1-5 except 6. The main challenge was, I was having too many assignments from my classes but I tried and finished all of themwithout a problem.


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? 

I have a software development class that I'm taking this semester and pretty much everything I did in class and I'm happy to put what I learned into practice and it was a great experience, I can't wait for what real-world project looks like. 


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific.  

I will be adding more functions that add time so the player has limited minutes to finish it. I will design the appearance of the game change everything from what it is now.
